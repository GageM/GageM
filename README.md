 <h2>About Me</h2> <!-- About Me -->
 <p> 
  <div>
    My story as a programmer and artist began in 2014 when a friend and I started using Unity to create games. 
    I quickly developed a passion for creating beautiful worlds and bringing them to life. 
    That passion led me to attend Humber College for an Advanced Diploma in Game Programming and to graduate from the program with Honours in 2024.

  <div>
    As an artist, I have developed my skills to work in any part of a 3D asset pipeline. 
    I am familiar with 3D programs such as Blender, 3DS Max, the Janga FX Suite, and Adobe’s Substance Designer, Painter and Sampler.  
    I am also constantly learning new and industry-standard techniques such as high-poly to low-poly baking, and utilizing seamless and trim textures.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    As a programmer, I have also created several projects in C++ and C# that span a variety of fields such as procedural generation, physics programming, artificial intelligence, game programming using Unity and Unreal engines, and game engine programming with SDL, OpenGL and Vulkan.
